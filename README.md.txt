Salary Prediction – EDA & Linear Regression  
Project Overview  
This project explores a Salary dataset to analyze salary trends and predict salaries based on experience using Linear Regression. We perform EDA to visualize trends and understand salary distributions.  
Techniques Used  
- EDA 
- Simple Linear Regression for salary prediction  
- Joblib for model deployment
